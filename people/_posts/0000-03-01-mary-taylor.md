### About 
I am a MSc student in the Neuroscience Graduate Program. I completed my undergraduate degree at Brock University in Neuropsychology. My work is focused on the use of functional and structural imaging to characterize and monitor network patterns in patients with focal epilepsy, as well as relating these patterns to cognitive performance.
