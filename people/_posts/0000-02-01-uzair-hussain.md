### About

I am a postdoc at Robarts Research Institute at Western University, London. I obtained my Ph.D. from Memorial University in theoretical physics with a focus on black holes. My MSc was in theoretical astrophysics from the University of Waterloo and BSc in physics from McMaster University. My research focuses on diffusion MRI (dMRI), and my current projects aim to model diffusion processes in geometrically complex regions of the brain like the neocortex and the hippocampus. We employ techniques from differential geometry to flatten these complex regions and then model diffusion processes in the flattened space in order to enhance detection of abnormalities from dMRI.
