### About

I am a MSc student in the Neuroscience graduate program. I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Behaviour from McMaster University. My current research focuses on microstructural modelling of the Hippocampus in native and flattened space using diffusion MRI.
