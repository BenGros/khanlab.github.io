### About

I am a Scientist at the Robarts Research Institute and Assistant Professor in the Department of Medical Biophysics and Medical Imaging at Western University. I obtained my PhD from Simon Fraser University and joined Western University in 2011 as a post-doctoral fellow. My research is focussed on the development of intelligent image processing and analysis technologies, and their application in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.
