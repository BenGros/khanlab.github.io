    long_desc: "<p>Neurosurgery to treat drug-resistant epilepsy or brain cancer 
    is very challenging, as the surgeon needs to trade-off completely removing 
    the disease, with sparing healthy functional tissue. Planning how much of the 
    brain to treat requires knowledge of the neurological pathways and abnormal 
    regions, however this can be difficult as the boundaries are not always well 
    defined. Incorrectly defining the region to treat can carry a great deal of 
    risk; if too small, the surgery will not be effective, and if too large, 
    function may be altered negatively. </p>

    <p> We are working on computational tools to guide neurosurgeons towards 
    more optimal resections, biopsies, and electrode implantations by extracting 
    and exploiting the information present in medical images. </p>"

    long_desc: "<p>Histology provides a microscopic view into tissue and, when 
    possible, is an invaluable way to validate what we are observing with 
    medical imaging.  We have the opportunity to access tissue obtained from 
    surgical procedures, however, correcting for the tissue deformations that 
    occur from resection and histological processing remains a major challenge.</p>
    
    <p>We are developing semi-automated pipelines for performing this image 
    registration in applications that include temporal lobe resections, and 
    carotid plaque endartarectomies, and are employing these tools to investigate 
    the correlation between imaging and histological markers. </p>"

    long_desc: "<p> Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disorder, and many 
    patients do not have control of seizures with anti-epileptic medications. 
    In these cases, it becomes imperative to map out where the seizures are 
    originating from in order to perform focal surgical treatment. </p>
    
    <p>We are using advanced imaging techniques, such as quantitative 
    multi-parametric MRI and ultra-high-field MRI in order to detect lesions 
    which may be otherwise hidden, and to better understand how the brain and 
    itâ€™s networks are affected by epilepsy. </p>"

    disorders, both at the macro and the micro scale. We have been investigating 
    sensitive techniques for quantifying brain structure using anatomical MRI 
    morphometry techniques that are sensitive to the size and shape of the 
    cortical and subcortical structures, and diffusion MRI to investigate 
    microstructure.</p>"
